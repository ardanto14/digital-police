# DigitalPolice
DigitalPolice is B21-CAP0081 capstone project for Bangkit 2021 program. The product is an android application to receive alert notification from our machine learning model that is trained to detect anomaly in surveillance camera video. The detected anomaly is indicated as a crime, in which for our project we use these type of crimes: Robbery, Vandalism, Stealing, and Assault.

This github repository containing the code for Machine Learning implementation, consists of:
- sources for C3D pretrained model, misc, dataset and cited paper.
- Data preprocessing steps by extracting features from raw dataset in a notebook
- Building and training model steps in a notebook
